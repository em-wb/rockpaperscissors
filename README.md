Rock, paper scissors task as part of the Odin Project. 

My first attempt at a project in javascript. 

Skills:
Break a larger task into small tasks, using pseudocode
Apply foundational learning using, for example: functions, variables, if/else statements, console.log, math.random...
Learn how to use for loops
Use resources online to help solve problems

Reflections:
The game only plays 5 rounds, even if the user makes an error entering their play. I will come back and fix this bug when I have the knowledge to do so.
